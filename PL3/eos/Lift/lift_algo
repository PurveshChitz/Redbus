Initialization:

a.Four input pins 7,8,9,10.
and 11 to 19, 21, 23, 24 output pins.

b. Seven segment led pins are active low pins.
numbered from is 11 to 18.

c. There are four green and four yellow LEDs to indicate the current moving direction of lift. LED pins are active high pins. 

d. For green pins are: 12,14,16, 18 from top to bottom.

e. For yellow pins are: 11,13,15, 17 from top to bottom.

f. Switch pins are the input pins numbered from 7 to 10  for each floor.

7 for the third floor.

9 for second floor.

8 for first floor

10 for ground floor.











Algorithm:

1. Initially make all pins configurations.

2. Define function zero, one, two, three for displying corresponding number on the Seven Segment display. Define functions glow_green, glow_yellow to glow green or yellow LEDs respectively.

3. Intialize lift_status variable to indicate current position of the lift. Initially lift_status=0 i.e. Initially lift is on the ground floor.

4. Initially display zero on the Seven segment display.

5. Check input of the switches. 

6. Check the curren position of the lift, according to that glow LEDs and display dynamic position of the lift on seven segment display. 

7. Once lift is reached to destination change lift_status variable to destination floor number.

8. Continue steps 5 to 7.
